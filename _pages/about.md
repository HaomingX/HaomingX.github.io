## About Me

I am Haoming Xu, a Master's student in the College of Software at Zhejiang University, focusing on large language models and natural language processing.

My research interests center on **editing, unlearning** and **continual learning** for large language models. I work on developing methods to remove specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving performance, as well as exploring how models can learn continuously and achieve evolution. I also maintain an active interest in model reliability, hallucination mitigation, and broader topics in AI safety and robustness.

I am seeking collaborations with research-minded peers (undergraduates and master's students preparing for further study are welcome) and with fellow researchers.

If you are interested in my work, please contact me at **haomingxu2003@gmail.com**.

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=I_sHcmgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
