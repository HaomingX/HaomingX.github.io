## About Me

I am a researcher in Natural Language Processing at Zhejiang University, focusing on large language models, particularly methods for **machine unlearning**, mitigating hallucinations, and incorporating structured knowledge for reliable response generation. I develop benchmarks and techniques to improve factual consistency and robustness in LLMs.

My research interests include:
- **Machine Unlearning**: Developing methods to remove specific knowledge from large language models while preserving performance
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Designing techniques to reduce factual errors and improve reliability in model outputs
- **Multimodal Learning**: Exploring how vision-language models can enhance text generation through dynamic correction
- **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating structured knowledge bases to improve factual accuracy

## Education

- **Master of Software Engineering**  
  Zhejiang University, 2025 - 2028

- **Bachelor of Computer Science**  
  Harbin Institute of Technology, 2021 - 2025

## Research Highlights

My recent work has focused on:
- **Unlearning Techniques**: Proposed novel frameworks for machine unlearning in LLMs, achieving effective removal of targeted information while maintaining model performance
- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Developed dynamic correction decoding strategies that significantly reduce factual errors in multimodal language models
- **Benchmark Development**: Contributed to evaluation frameworks for assessing unlearning effectiveness in semantic understanding tasks
